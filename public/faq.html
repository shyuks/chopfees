                    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                    <h2>Who can use chopfees?</h2>
                    <p>Chopfees.com is available to business owners with
                    existing credit card processors (with whom they are unhappy
                    or curiously intrigued as to why we’d help save you
                    money).</p>

                    <h2>Why should we trust chopfees?</h2>
                    <p>Our process is truly confidential – no one will know who
                    you used to help reduce your monthly fees. We will contact
                    your merchant provider discretely and professionally. We are
                    truly tired of seeing people being taken advantage of, and
                    want to help you save money.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Send us one full month of your merchant processing statement.</li>
                            <li>We will negotiate directly with your processing company.</li>
                            <li>You save money. Period.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>We are a large company, can you still help?</h2>
                    <p>Absolutely. No business is too large, too small, or cannot be negotiated.</p>
                    
                    <h2>We are a small company, is it worth trying?</h2>
                    <p>Is the sky blue? We are absolutely invested to small
                    business owners – after all, we are in the same boat!</p>
